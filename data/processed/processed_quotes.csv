She had always tried to keep this from happening to her, always been terrified of displaying men, terrified of the names she would be called if she did.

She had always suspected that if provoked, those names were always close to the surface, ready to lash out and destroy her."
"Throughout my life, I have never stopped to strategic about my next steps. I often just keep walking along, through whichever door opens. I have been on a journey and this journey has never stopped.

They are the reasons I kept walking, and will keep walking, as long as my knees hold out."

"While most people are playing it safe and doing everything they can to avoid pain, successful people know that they must face their fears and do what needs to be done regardless of how they feel. They do not necessarily like the hard work, but they are willing to do it because they like the results."
"While your ego is always trying to figure out its place in the world, your true self knows that your place is always right here, right now."
"Believe it or not, your body has nothing but unconditional love for you. The proof? Without any effort on your part, your heart is beating, your lungs are breathing, and the rhythm of life is gracious flowing through you every second of every day unconditionally."

"I shall never forget the African torture victim, a young man no older than I was at the time, who had become mentally ill after all he had endured in his homeland. He troubled uncontrollable as he spoke into a video camera about the brutality inflicted upon him. He was a foot taller than I was, and seemed as fragile as a child. I was given the job of escorting him back to the Underground Station afterwards, and this man whose life had been shattered by cruelty took my hand with exquisite courtesy, and wished me future happiness."

So if you are a person with connections to life, a few tendrils eventually break through the sidewalk of loss, and you notice them, maybe space out studying them for a few moments, or maybe they tackle you into movement and response, if only because you have to scratch your nose."
"We human beings do not realize how great God is. He has given us an extraordinary brain and a sensitive loving heart.

As I found with my ear, no one knows how much power they have in their each and every organ until they lose one."

"Beyond aspects of pain that are physical, thought Oppenheimer, sickness or injury or probation, beyond the so called obvious, suffering can be a work of art. It can be made of buried and rising things, helpless and undiscovered, song of frustrated want, silence after desire. It can be the test of the self falling short, constrained, distorted, disturbed or rebuffed, the vacuum left by longing, call without an answer."
"it is love, imperfect and ordered, that keeps them apart, even as it holds them somehow together."
"Putting everything on hold to achieve the one thing you think will make you happy will actually mean that you are miserable along the way to getting there, and when you get there, you might find that the thing wanted does not make you as happy as you thought it would.

Of course imagination is the beginning of creation. Without imagination there can be no creation.
"No true friendship takes account of credit and debt. It gives freely, without thought of compensation or reward."
"Know before whom thou stands. Understand your friends for who they are, not who you wish them to be. Accept them for their flaws as well as their attributes. Turn to them for their strengths, what good stuff they can bring to your life, and forget about the rest. To ask for more only sets you up for failure."

Or, after a rainstorm, wasps of clouds lung to the trees as if scared to let go. Behind, finals peaked out style between the clouds."
The world is full of wonderful things you have not seen yet. Do not ever give up on the chance of seeing them.
"Alone, I relisted the bird songs, the drone of pushed conversation from neighboring tables, and the gentle mapping of waves sliding on the shore. I did not feel the passage of time. There was no destination propellant me forward, no past and no future. Each glorious moment was replaced by the next."
"But the vagrant owns the whole vast earth that ends only at the nonexistent horizon, and his empire is an intangible one, for his domination and enjoyment of it are things of the spirit."
"You are only given one life, one chance at fully living it... take risks, believe in your dreams, explore the world and her people, live out loud!"
"Travel is the discovery of truth; an affirmation of the promise that human kind is far more beautiful than it is flawed. With each trip comes a new optimism that where there is despair and hardship, there are ideas and people just waiting to be energies, to be empowered, to make a difference for good."
"We are torn between a nostalgia for the familiar and an urge for the foreign and strange. As often as not, we are homesick most for the places we have never known."
"Can I love someone... and still think fly? Love is flying, sown, floating. Thought is solitary flight, beating wings."

"It is not enough to have had an interesting or hilarious or tragic life. Art is not anecdote. It is the consciousness we bring to bear on our lives. For what happened in the story to transcend the limits of the personal, it must be driven by the engine of what the story means."
"Everybody pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was. I detect jargon of every kind, and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning."
"Given the ease with which health infused life with meaning and purpose, it is shocking how swiftly illness steals away those uncertainties Time unused and only endured still vanishes, as if time itself is starving, and each day is swallowed whole, leaving no crumbs, no memory, no trace at all."
"Do not fall into the trap of sacrificing your self esteem for affection and acceptance. No matter what your size, you are a sexy goddess. Remember that."
"The bond between food and me is like other relationships in my life  complicated, evolving, demanding, and in need of constant work. But together we have come so far, moving from my childhood obligation to clean my plate, to a mindless need to fill up, to a truly flourishing and measurable exchange. That is the real reward."
"The important thing to remember, ... is that you are a human being and worthy of respect."

I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that.
"I will never attend an anti war rally; if you have a peace rally, invite me."
Mockery is childish. It does not become you.
"I am not talking about the blood ecstasy. I am talking about my being able to fill that emotion void she has. You know her as well as I do, maybe better. She acres with it. She needs to be accepted for who she is so badly. And I was able to do that. Do you know good that felt? To be able to show someone that, yes, you are someone worth sacrificing for? That you like them for their faults and that you respect them for their ability to rise above them?"

"The great strength she had used in the old days to conquer and subdue, to win her will and to defend her way, seemed now a power but to protect the suffering and uphold the weak, and this she did, not alone in novels but in the brilliant court and world of fashion, for there she found suffering and weakness also, all the more bitter and sorrowful since it dared not cry aloud."
"There are certain people who will always seek to criticize. This has nothing to do with you. It must be hard to be inside their head, you know? I mean if they find so much fault in everyone around them... then one can only imagine the faults they must see in themselves."
Do not overestimate everyone else and underestimate yourself.
"It seems to me that I cannot afford, as a self respecting individual, to refuse to do a thing merely because it will make me disliked or bring down a storm of criticism on my head."
"One of the unexpected and wonderfully fair things I have learned in my career is that if Hollywood were filled just with perfect looking people, then soap operas would be the most watched things in the world. But they are not. Looks are great, but they are not compelling enough. I have noticed that successful actors with long careers are usually talented actors with charismatic screen presence, and all of them exile one thing  confidence."
"You have to let people see what you wrote. It will never be perfect, but perfect is operated."
You should not want to be like everyone else. Then you would not be like you.
"This is the key to the entire universe. You know what this is? It is not a microphone, this right here is your voice. This physical thing just amplifier it. Do not be afraid of your voice. You have a voice without a microphone. Use it and do not let anybody snuff you out and tell you do not have one."

"Your qualifications, your C, are not your life, though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two."
Failure is a cruise. Not a tattoo.
You will only fail to learn if you do not learn from failing.
"You will fail. That is great. Here is a secret for you   that is the only way you can learn. Learning has to cost you something. If you fail but learn something from your failure, you will grow."
Failure in and of itself is not a bad thing. But failing to learn from it is inexcusable.
The things that I regret in my life are not errors of judgement but failures of feeling.
Sometimes the best things for us are not necessarily the things we want.
I believe the Lord has chosen me to spread His word through my words and who am I to question His plans for me?
"He is nothing more than one of my pawns. However, he is not a normal pawn. He is a pawn that can get across the whole board in one move."
Start from your heart. The greatest journeys begin on the inside.
"I want to share my story, and I want to know yours. I believe with all my heart that sharing our stories, the real, ugly, broken ones, is one of the most powerful things in the world, because to share our story we must first accept it. We must own it. We must stop running from it or showing it into the corner when company comes over. To share our story is to admit that we have been changed."

"Women have to support each other more. Women get women. We understand each other when we are happy or sad, when we have our period, start a new job, or fall in love. We are typically the caretaker. Let us take care of each other, start building each other up. The stereotype with women is that we are fatty and vindictive. It is important to fight against that notion. I have a no By policy in my circle."
I am more than my measurements. The cycle of body shading needs to end. I am over it  My body is M body. I will call the shots.
Do not expect to receive love from someone else you do not give yourself.
I want to save the world but I have not worked out a way to save myself yet.
Be just the ball you need to heal what fails you.
"But the healing place is with in you. Healing is a gift you were granted at birth, just as you were granted to others. Use your gifts, child. Use the beauty, the courage, the hope and the love that is within you. Call upon your strength. Use compassion and faith. Even during sad times joy is within you. Bring it forth.

"if you have someone who wants to heal, sometime they will respond to the unconventional. Their minds are more open to healing, so their bodies become more willing too. I believe that medication, while a wonderful thing, has its limits. That there are answers to be found in the unconventional."
"And it is always better, is not it, when you discover answers on your own?"
"So, go. Travel far. Travel courageous. Travel young."
You are not alone. You are never alone. Use creativity to change what world you are in at this moment.

The expectation that To women need to be more liable than men is bullshit and in need of a change.

You can waste a perfectly good life trying to meet the standards of someone who thinks you are not good enough because they cannot understand who you are.

"Because... Because it is so good, and there is only one chance to read a book for the first time, and I want it to last. That experience. I would finish it in a day otherwise, and that would be like... like eating a carbon of ice cream in one sitting. Too much richness over too quickly. This way, I can draw it out.

"Then you will need to teach him again, until he is learned. Just as I have done with you boys. That is what God does with us, after all. Puts us out into the world where the only real boundary is that of His love. His love either compel us, or restraint us. There is nothing stronger, Danny."

It all depends on how desperately you want to use that door."

"Hey, mister, I do not think so. You go outside and yell at sky, you so angry."

Or I could have ended living alone in a dump apartment with the flesh eating virus I contracted from a public toilet. Could have are always a great unknown."
"Secrets become harder to keep the older you get. The things you think you can suppress, those idiosyncrasies and fantasies you hope no one will ever discover, become harder and harder to hide as the years advance. Partly it is maturity the fear of discovery grows smaller, less significant, for you learn that none of us is perfect, that human nature is flawed, that life twists and turns in all sorts of unexpected ways and it is okay to end up in a different place to where you expected."
"We are all a grab bag of good and evil, and by and large cannot tell which is which."
There is something about human nature which draws us to people who are authentic and makes us want to repel those that are not.

Once you have learned to consider these questions and to bring them into all your actions, you will have little difficulty in clarifying the means. The means are available whenever you ask. You can, however, save time if you do not protect this step unduly. The correct focus will shorten it immeasurably."
"Do not wait for your ship to come in, swim out to it."
"Enclose your heart in times of need with the steel of your determination and your strength. In doing this, all things will be wearable."

"Michael felt as if his heart might burst. With the death of the council he had felt as though he had lost everything that mattered to him, but here in his arms, he found the last piece of hope he had left in the world.  We have to go back and help Game."
"Game realized he was standing there alone, with a goofy smile on his face. Living inside, he closed the door behind him, her words still lingering in his mind. Game wanted more than anything to be able to choose happiness. He wanted a rain storm to make him smile. He desired that the simple task of cooking would make him dance. To Game, however, it did not seem as simple as just making a choice. He hoped her joy was contagious, because he was in uncharted territories."
The roar of the crowd began to grow. He heard them harmonious stopping their feet in a rhythm that cried out for battle. Game glance across the arena to several cages that were shielded by large clocks. Whatever was inside was clearly becoming agitated by the noise of the crowd. The captive creatures began beating against the bars. Random secret shrinks and grows came from their general area.
"He did not know Rachel very well, but assumed her behavior would be similar to most women he encountered. As soon as he stepped foot inside she would attack, not allowing him to get in a word. At least that was what he imagined."
"He knew she loved him in that moment. Game never wanted to be part of the holy fight, but now he was, he was not about to lose."
"I still do not understand anything  except that somehow I know that You are love. And that in my heart has been so great a love for Christy as I did not know could exist on this earth. You, God, must be responsible. You must have put it there. So what do I do with it now?"

"Work hard, play hard, love hard.  3."
Cinderella never asked for a prince. She asked for a night off and a dress.
"People say not to judge a book by its cover, but what if you somehow read the inside of the book without seeing the cover first? And what if you really liked what was inside the book? Of course when you go to close the book and are about to see the cover for the first time, you hope it is something you will find attractive. Because who wants an incredibly written book sitting on their bookshelf if they have to stare at a shift cover?"
"I wish I could have healed your misery, muenchen your sorrow."
"Because it is not muscles that make men strong. Secret do. The more secret you keep, the stronger you are on the inside."
"People that you meet, are pebbles in your river, but those that you hold true shall follow your current, like a leaf atop a stream. The boulder that blocks your path however, you just have to be willing to climb, or break it down with time."

"When life knocks us down, God CAN put us back together again. He can meet us in our brokenness and restore us to something even more glorious than we were before we were shattered."
"Do not rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth. Only YOU can be responsible for it. You have to invest in yourself, or no one else will."
"Perhaps the most pressing need for there to be a forever after, is because that is how long it will take man to thank his Creator for all His wondrous deeds."

My dogs have been the reason I have women up every single day of my life with a smile on my face.
"Pain is not wrong. Reacting to pain as wrong initiates the trance of unworthiness. The moment we believe something is wrong, our world shrinks and we lose ourselves in the effort to combat the pain."
"We think that if we just mediated enough or logged enough or ate perfect food, everything would be perfect. But from the point of view of someone who is awake, that is death. Seeking security or perfection, rejoining in feeling confirmed and whole, self contained and comfortable, is some kind of death. It does not have any fresh air. There is no room for something to come in and interrupt all that. We are killing the moment by controlling our experience."

Rise above the storm and you will find the sunshine.
"Service is the rent we pay for being. It is the very purpose of life, and not something you do in your spare time."
"Helping, fixing, and serving represent three different ways of seeing life. When you help, you see life as weak. when you fix, you see life as broken. When you serve, you see life as whole. Fixing and helping may be the work of the ego, and service the work of the soul."
"Each of us is called upon to take a stand. So in these days ahead, as we examine ourselves and each other, our works, our fears, our differences, our sisterhood and survival, I urge you to tackle what is most difficult for us all, self scrutiny of our complacencies, the idea that since each of us believes she is on the side of right, she need not examine her position."
"You need to be proud of the fact that you survived everything you went through as a child. Do not seperate yourself from that life. Embrace it, because I am so fucking proud of you."
"They forget that we, too, have earned the right to live! So I say if we are going to die, my friend, let us die trying, not sitting."

"I tell you not to be timid. I tell you to make the choices, make the mistakes, big, terrible, reckless mistakes, really screw it all up. I tell you it is the only way."

"When all you wanted was to be wanted, you wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now."
Cowardice is for towards. Fear is for people with brains and eyes and functioning nerve endings.
I have been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I have never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do.
I cannot go down without a fight. Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to  to show the Capitol they do not own me. That I am more than just a piece in their Games.
"It is okay to climb as long as you are not afraid, because being afraid is what made you fall."
There is no history of anything happening until it does. And then there is.
I cannot be my own person if I constantly require someone else to hold me together.
Great difficulties may be surmounted by patience and perseverance.
Difficulties are what makes it honorable and interesting to be alive.
Adversity is neither friend nor foe. It is a common acquaintance that is desired less and rewarded most when embraced.
"You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity."
"You cannot stop the birds of sorrow from flying over your head, but you can stop them nesting in your hair."
"Our dream of life will end as dreams do end, abruptly and completely, when the sun rises, when the light comes. And we will think, all that fear and all that grief were about nothing. But that cannon be true. I cannot believe we will forget our sorrow altogether. That would mean forgetting that we had lived, human speaking. Sorrow seems to me to be a great part of the substance of human life."
"To The Lilies among Thistle, Just like a lily, a beautiful life does not just happen overnight. It is built daily through informed choices, commitment, faith and prayer.

It is a difficult, challenging journey filled with both laughter and tears, but a fulfilling one as you will soon find out.

"Sometimes we need to examine who we are, what we stand for and the people we allow in our lives."
It takes a little crazy to make a difference.
Were revolutions ever really that we thought them to be?
Were revolutions ever really what we thought them to be?
"The man journeyed far, and he heard and saw many strange things on his travels. He learned that   that the friend and the enemy are but two faces of the same self. That the path one believes chosen long since, constant and unchangeable, straight and wide, can alter in an instant. Can branch, and twist and lead the traveler to places far beyond his widest imagining. That there are mysteries beyond the mind of mortal man, and that to deny their existence is to spend a life of half consciousness."
"My emotions still held a stubborn hope that humans could be loyal, that they could hold out against the promise of an easy life. But I knew better."
"And even if you hate her, cannot stand her, even if she is ruining your life, there is something about her, some romance, some power. She is absolutely herself. No matter how hard you try, you will never get to her. And when she dies, the world will be flat, too simple, reasonable, fair."

"History is a set of repeating circles, like the tide. The wind does blow through the ruins of tomorrow. But it is more a question of two steps forward, one step back. Humans and dragons make the same mistakes, again and again, but things do get better over time."
It is a lot easier to be lost than found.
"But for now, the future, like the past, means nothing. For now, there is only a homestead built of trash and scraps, at the edge of a broken city, just beyond a towering city dump; and our arrival hungry, and half frozen, to a place of food and water and walls that keep out the brutal winds. This, for us, is heaven."
"If you always do what interests you, at least one person is pleased."
Because this is what I believe   that second chances are stronger than secrets. You can let secrets go. But a second chance? You do not let that pass you by.
God has given you talents and opportunities. Size them today    not tomorrow.
"There is a coherence in things, a stability; something... is immune from change and shines out... in the face of the flowing, the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby."

"You have got choices, like any other creature. You can stumble down that road, pretending you cannot help it. You can curl up and die of regret and sorrow for what you have done. Or you can get up and fight, even though the battle might be lost.  Finn."
"She sits down and puts her hand to her chest and rocks. Thinks of all she has lost and will lose. All she has had and will have.
